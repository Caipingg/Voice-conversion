poetry init           # Create pyproject.toml interactively
poetry add            # Add a dependency
poetry install        # Install dependencies & make a venv
poetry env activate (then copy paste output)  # Enter the virtual environment
poetry build          # Build package for distribution
poetry publish        # Publish to PyPI

sometimes need to switch the python interpreter


obscure notes:

poetry env info --path
